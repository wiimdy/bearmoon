#### minimumIncentiveThreshold State Variable Spec

Mechanism to block reward allocation to depleted vaults by setting a minimum incentive token holding threshold

#### **De-pegging Thresholds (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%) Rationale**

0.1% = Minimum arbitrage profit margin vs. gas fees, 0.2% = Honey system DEFAULT\_PEG\_OFFSET value, 0.5% = Chainlink oracle deviation tolerance upper limit

#### **Market Volatility Data**

1 minute duration = 2 consecutive block confirmations to prevent single block manipulation, 1 hour = 180 block stability verification for price recovery reliability

#### isPegged Implementation

Pegging state verification logic that aggregates multiple oracles and references only active ones for reliable price judgment

#### Oracles Used by Berachain (Chainlink, etc.)

Mandatory reference to 3+ oracles and automatic exclusion of disabled/emergency-stopped oracles to enhance manipulation resistance

#### calculateLoss Formula Reference

Calculates loss as De-pegging Ratio Ã— Asset Value, requires user risk notification and acknowledgeRisk confirmation

```solidity
// Basic Loss Calculation:
Loss = AssetValueAtPeg Ã— DepegRatio
// User Asset Amount to Receive:
UserAssetAmount = HoneyAmount Ã— AssetWeight
// De-pegging Ratio:
DepegRatio = (PegPrice - CurrentPrice) / PegPrice
// Asset Value at Peg:
AssetValueAtPeg = UserAssetAmount Ã— PegPrice
// Final Loss:
Loss = AssetValueAtPeg Ã— DepegRatio
```
