# Foreword

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This document identifies potential security threats in Berachain's Proof of Liquidity (PoL) system and presents practical guidelines to prevent them.

The Berachain ecosystem introduces a new economic model through its PoL mechanism, but it can also be exposed to new security threats. This guideline aims to protect the ecosystem from these threats and provide developers with the necessary instructions and best practices to build safer and more reliable dApps.

Furthermore, it is written for chain operators, dApp builders, liquidity providers, and community members to ensure the secure operation and sustainable growth of Berachain.

Our Bearmoon team has created this security guideline document through code analysis of the protocol and in-depth research on the PoL structure. Through this document, we aim to provide practical and applicable security guidelines for Berachain's core contracts and major dApp protocols, contributing to Berachain's development as a more secure and trusted network.
