# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This document identifies potential security threats that may arise within VeraChain’s PoL (Proof of Liquidity) mechanism and provides practical guidelines to prevent them.

The VeraChain ecosystem introduces a new economic model through the PoL mechanism; however, it may also be exposed to new security vulnerabilities. This guideline aims to protect the ecosystem from such threats and offer the necessary instructions and best practices for developers to build safer and more reliable dApps.

Furthermore, it has been prepared so that all participants—including chain operators, dApp builders, liquidity providers, and community members—can refer to it for the secure operation of VeraChain and the sustainable growth of its ecosystem.

Our Bearmoon team has developed this security guideline document through code analysis of the protocol and in-depth research on the PoL structure. Through this document, we aim to provide practical and applicable security instructions for VeraChain’s core contracts and key dApp protocols, thereby contributing to the evolution of VeraChain into a more secure and trusted network.
